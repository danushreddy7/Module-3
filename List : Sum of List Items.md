# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim:
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm:
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program:
```
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
total = 0
for num in numbers:
    total += num
print("The sum of all elements in the list is:", total)
```
## Output:
```
Input                   Result
 10
 20
 30         The sum of all elements in the list is: 150
 40
 50
```
## Result:
The program  for sum of all element was successful.
